## Credit

I credit an ENORMOUS amount of inspiration to Martin Blais of [beancount][]. While my
code is my own, his tool documentation, design documentation, and enhancement proposals
have been tremendously helpful in developing my understanding of basic accounting &
bookkeeping.

Much credit should also go to [actual-budget][] - it's the tool that I'm currently using
to track my spending. While its shortcomings (for my use case) have inspired me to make
my own tool - that is in no way a knock against its utility, and I expect to be
subconsiously influenced by its UI & presentation.

If, somehow, you've discovered this in searching for a good accounting/budgeting app, I
would STRONGLY encourage you to use `beancount` or `actual-budget` instead
